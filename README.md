## Dynamic Project

This project, for Andrew McNutt's "Data Visualization for Policy Analysis" class, explores different dimensions of social mobility for Mexicans aged 25 to 64 in 2016 using data from Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). The 2016 Module on Intergenerational Social Mobility (MMSI) lets us compare an individual's perceived current socioeconomic status with their perceived status at age 14. Although in this context, socioeconomic status is a subjective measure of an individual's economic and social position in regard to others, it provides with the unique opportunity to investigate whether Mexicans face significant barriers to social mobility given their skin color.
