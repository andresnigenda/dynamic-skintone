        Moving up the ladder? How skin tone determines social mobility in Mexico
      </h1>
      <p>
        In Mexico, there is persistent social stratification by skin color.
        Lightest-skinned Mexicans have, on average, 1.5 additional years of
        schooling and earn 53% more per hour than their darkest-skinned peers.
        It is no surprise then, that having a darker skin tone is related to
        lower upward mobility in Mexico. However, these inequities are
        accentuated for some and attenuated for others according to their
        sociodemographic characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project explores the different dimensions and breakdowns of social
        mobility for Mexicans aged 25 to 64 in 2016 using data from Mexico's
        National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). The 2016 Module
        on Intergenerational Social Mobility (MMSI) lets us map the perceived
        socioeconomic status of individuals at age 14 and compare it to their
        current perceived status. The MMSI also provides information on the
        perceived skin color using the PERLA scale, which assigns skin color
        according to a palette with eleven skin tones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each bucket on the matrix is colored according to the average skin color
        of the population it represents. For example, in 2016, 0.11% of Mexicans
        perceived themselves to be at the highest socioeconomic status when they
        were at the lowest at age 14, and the average skin tone of this subset
        of the population was 7.79, which corresponds to color number 8 on the
        PERLA scale.

            The lighter your skin tone, the more likely you are to be better
            off, or at least not worse off than when you were 14 y.o.
          </h3>
          <p>
            If we look at all Mexicans aged 25 to 64, we can notice two things.
            First, the bucket with highest economic mobility has a lighter
            average skin tone than the bucket with the highest downward
            mobility. Second, buckets in the upper part of the matrix (buckets
            with higher upward mobility and lower downward mobility) have a skin
            tone that is, on average, lighter than the ones on the bottom half.

            Social mobility for darker-skinned women is lower than for their
            darker-skinned peers
          </h3>
          <p>
            For women, the overwhelming majority of higher upward mobility and
            lower downward mobility buckets are lighter skinned on average. That
            is, if you are a Mexican woman that was born with a darker skin
            tone, not only are you more likely to not go up the ladder of social
            mobility when compared to your lighter-skinned peers, but you are
            also more likely to have a lower socioeconomic level, and stay
            there.

            Afromexicans have an even more reduced spectrum of upward mobility
          </h3>
          <p>
            According to the latest inter-census survey, 1.2% of Mexico's
            population identifies as afro-descendants. Given the previous
            patterns that we have observed, it is not surprising to see that
            even among Afromexicans, lighter-skinned Afromexicans have better
            mobility outcomes than darker-skinned ones. Even worse, there are
            gaps in the higher upward mobility and lower income mobility
            buckets.

            In addition to perceived socioeconomic status, the MMSI survey
            classifies dwellings into four strata according to specific
            socioeconomic characteristics of the people living in them as well
            as the physical characteristics and equipment of the dwellings based
            on 24 variables recovered from the census. <br />
            <br />
            Mexicans at the highest socioeconomic stratum are whiter than the
            average Mexican. Furthermore, the bin with the highest mobility,
            where individuals went from having the lowest perceived
            socioeconomic level at age 14 to the highest current level had an
            average skin tone of 9.39 out of 11, where 11 is the lightest
            possible skin tone.
