        Moving up the ladder? How skin tone determines social mobility in Mexico
      </h1>
      <p>
        Inequity is often a multidimensional phenomenon that disproportionately
        affects some sets of population. In Mexico this is particularly true
        among people with different skin tones. Some research has shown how
        lightest-skinned Mexicans have, on average, 1.5 additional years of
        schooling and 53% more hourly earnings than the darkest-skinned ones.
        This project explores how educational attainment has changed between
        Mexicans aged 25-64 in 2016 and their parents for different demographic
        and socioeconomic breakdowns.

        This project uses data from Mexico's National Institute of Statistics
        and Geography (INEGI) 2016 Module on Intergenerational Social Mobility
        (MMSI).
