        Moving up the ladder? How skin color influences social mobility in
        Mexico
      </h1>
      <p id="name">by Andr√©s Nigenda</p>
      <p>
        In Mexico, there is pervasive social stratification by skin color.
        Lightest-skinned Mexicans have, on average, 1.5 additional years of
        schooling and earn 53% more per hour than their darkest-skinned peers.<a
          href="#1"
          ><sup>/1</sup></a
        >
        This stratification is also persistent over time: social mobility for
        darker skinned Mexicans is reduced when compared to their lighter
        skinned peers. These inequities are accentuated for some and attenuated
        for others given other sociodemographic characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project explores different dimensions of social mobility for
        Mexicans aged 25 to 64 in 2016 using data from Mexico's National
        Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). The 2016 Module on
        Intergenerational Social Mobility (MMSI)<a href="#2"><sup>/2</sup></a>
        lets us compare an individual's perceived current socioeconomic status
        with their perceived status at age 14. Although in this context,
        socioeconomic status is a subjective measure of an individual's economic
        and social position in regard to others, it provides with the unique
        opportunity to investigate whether Mexicans face significant barriers to
        social mobility given their skin color.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MMSI also provides information on self-perceived skin color using
        Princeton's PERLA scale, which allows to assign skin color according to
        an eleven color palette.<a href="#3"><sup>/3</sup></a
        >All of the visualizations in this project follow this scale, where a
        value of 1 corresponds to the darkest skin color, and a value of 11 to
        the lightest skin color as follows:
      </p>
      <div id="legend"></div>
      <p>
        This scrollytelling explores social mobility by skin color through
        social mobility matrices. On each matrix, a square represents a bucket
        of mobility in which people perceive themselves to have a certain
        socioeconomic level given their perceived socioeconomic level when they
        were 14 years old. Each bucket is colored with the average skin color of
        people that land on it.<a href="#4"><sup>/4</sup></a> The upper diagonal
        of a matrix represents buckets with upward social mobility whereas the
        diagonal (under the purple steps) represents buckets with static or
        downward social mobility. Hover over each bucket to reveal a tooltip
        with bucket-specific information on the average skin tone, the total
        population and the population as a proportion of all buckets.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in 2016, 0.11% of all Mexicans perceived themselves to be
        at the highest socioeconomic level possible given that they were at the
        lowest one at age 14. The average skin color of this subset of the
        population was 7.79, which corresponds to color number 8 on the palette.

          <h2>All Mexicans</h2>
          <h3>
            The lighter your skin color, the more likely you are to be better
            off, or at least not worse off than when you were 14 years old
          </h3>
          <p>
            If we look at all Mexicans aged 25 to 64, we can notice two things.
            First, the bucket with the highest socioeconomic mobility has a
            lighter average skin color than the bucket with the highest downward
            mobility. Second, buckets in the upper part of the matrix (buckets
            with higher upward mobility and lower downward mobility) have a skin
            color that is, on average, lighter than the ones on the bottom half.

          <h2>Mexican Women</h2>
          <h3>
            Social mobility for darker-skinned women is lower than for their
            darker-skinned peers
          </h3>
          <p>
            The overwhelming majority of higher upward mobility and lower
            downward mobility buckets are lighter skinned on average. That is,
            if you are a Mexican woman that was born with a darker skin color,
            not only are you more likely to not go up the ladder of social
            mobility when compared to your lighter-skinned peers, but you are
            also more likely to have a lower socioeconomic level, and stay
            there.

          <h3>
            Afromexicans have a very reduced spectrum of upward mobility
          </h3>
          <p>
            According to the latest inter-census survey, 1.2% of Mexico's
            population identifies as afro-descendants. Given the previous
            patterns that we have observed, it is not surprising to see that
            even among Afromexicans, lighter-skinned Afromexicans have better
            mobility outcomes than darker-skinned ones. Even worse, there are
            gaps in the higher upward mobility and lower income mobility
            buckets.

          <h3>
            Mexicans with a high socioeconomic status are lighter-skinned
          </h3>
          <p>
            In addition to perceived socioeconomic status, the MMSI survey
            classifies dwellings into four strata according to specific
            socioeconomic characteristics of the people living in them as well
            as the physical characteristics and equipment of the dwellings based
            on 24 variables recovered from the census. <br />
            <br />
            Mexicans at the highest socioeconomic stratum are whiter than the
            average Mexican. Notice how the bin with the highest mobility in
            this stratum, where individuals went from having the lowest
            perceived socioeconomic level at age 14 to the highest current
            level, had an average skin color of 9.39 out of 11, where 11 is the
            lightest possible skin color.
